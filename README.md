# Description

This sample is a collection of extensions ready to be reused. Just add reference to the required files, load and use. Check each extension documentation for details.

1. [Camera Rotation](public/extensions/CameraRotation)
2. [Icon Markup](public/extensions/IconMarkupExtension)
3. [Nested Viewer](public/extensions/NestedViewerExtension)
4. [Transform](public/extensions/TransformationExtension)
5. [GoogleMapsLocator](public/extensions/GoogleMapsLocator)
6. [Draw Tool Extension](public/extensions/DrawToolExtension)
7. [Custom Properties Extension](public/extensions/CustomPropertiesExtension)
8. [XLS Extension](public/extensions/XLSExtension)

Extensions were created using a [Basic Skeleton](public/extensions/BasicSkeleton).

This sample is based on the [Learn Forge](http://learnforge.autodesk.io) tutorials in the section *View modelss*.

## Live Demo

Extensions are dynamically loaded and unloaded for testing on the live version.

# Setup

To use this sample, you will need Autodesk developer credentials. Visit the [Forge Developer Portal](https://developer.autodesk.com), sign up for an account, then [create an app](https://developer.autodesk.com/myapps/create). For this new app, use `http://localhost:3000/api/forge/callback/oauth` as the Callback URL, although it is not used on a 2-legged flow. Finally, take note of the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

## Run locally

Install [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org).

Clone this project or download it. It's recommended to install [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/). To clone it via command line, use the following (**Terminal** on MacOSX/Linux, **Git Shell** on Windows):

    git clone https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions.git

To run it, install the required packages, set the enviroment variables with your client ID & Secret and finally start it. Via command line, navigate to the folder where this repository was cloned to and use the following commands:

Mac OSX/Linux (Terminal)

    npm install
    export FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    export FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    npm start

Windows (use **Node.js command line** from the Start menu)

    npm install
    set FORGE_CLIENT_ID=<<YOUR CLIENT ID FROM DEVELOPER PORTAL>>
    set FORGE_CLIENT_SECRET=<<YOUR CLIENT SECRET>>
    npm start

Open the browser: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

# Steps to plug in new extension

1) Create folder in public/extensions with same name as extension name.
Structure of the extension folder is as shown below:
<pre>
ExtensionName[Folder]
        | 
        |->contents
        |     |
        |     |->main.js
        |     |->main.css
        |     |->assets[folder]
        |->config.json
</pre>        
Refer the [BasicSkeleton Extension](https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/tree/master/public/extensions/BasicSkeleton) for boilerplate code.

2) Each extension folder should be self-contained code, so that it's easily shareable between projects.
Extension[Folder]/config.json is meant for keeping the config of an extension and for sharing.

Extension config schema:
<pre>
{
    "name":"extension name registered",
    "displayname": "display name for the extension in list",
    "description": "description for the extension",
    "options":{model specific information array to pass on to extension constructor},
    "viewerversion":"viewer version",
    "loadonstartup": "true or false",
    "filestoload":{
        "cssfiles":["css file(s)"],
        "jsfiles":["js file(s)"]
    },
    "bloglink":"Blog link for working explanation of the extension (optional)",
    "includeinlist":"true or false"
}
</pre>
Example: [IconMarkupExtension config.json](https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/blob/master/public/extensions/IconMarkupExtension/config.json)

> Note: If your extension relies on event Autodesk.Viewing.OBJECT_TREE_CREATED_EVENT to load, in load function check if the data is already loaded, if not only then add the event listener, below code shows the structure.
<pre>
class MyExtension extends Autodesk.Viewing.Extension {
    ...
    load() {
        ...
        if (this.viewer.model.getInstanceTree()) {
            this.onTreeReady();
        } else {
            this.viewer.addEventListener(Autodesk.Viewing.OBJECT_TREE_CREATED_EVENT, this.onTreeReady.bind(this));
        }
        ...
    }
    ...
    onTreeReady() {
        const tree = this.viewer.model.getInstanceTree();
        ...
    }
    ...
}
</pre>
Example: [IconMarkupExtension load function](https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/blob/master/public/extensions/IconMarkupExtension/contents/main.js#L26)

> Note: After the new extension is added, please restart the server.

# Understanding extensionloader and using it in forge app

The way loose coupling between extensions and forge app is achived is with custom event, if you want to use extensionloader in your forge app, follow the three steps:

1) Copy paste the [extensions](https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/tree/master/public/extensions) in public folder of your app or in the folder where the index file resides. 

2) Include below script in index.html file
<pre>
<script src="/extensions/extensionloader.js"></script>
</pre>

3) Here's the linking part between the app and the extensionloader, in viewer [onDocumentLoadSuccess](https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/blob/master/public/js/ForgeViewer.js#L35) function, emit an event to inform the extensionloader that viewer has loaded the model with the below [code](https://github.com/autodesk-forge/forge-extensions/blob/master/public/js/ForgeViewer.js#L39):
<pre>
var ViewerInstance = new CustomEvent("viewerinstance", {detail: {viewer: viewer}});      
document.dispatchEvent(ViewerInstance);
</pre>
 To load an extension programmatically, emit the below event.
 <pre>
 var LoadExtensionEvent = new CustomEvent("loadextension", {
              detail: {
                extension: "Extension1",
                viewer: viewer
             }
         });
 document.dispatchEvent(LoadExtensionEvent);
 </pre>

To unload extension:
<pre>
 var UnloadExtensionEvent = new CustomEvent("unloadextension", {
              detail: {
                extension: "Extension1",
                viewer: viewer
             }
         });
 document.dispatchEvent(UnloadExtensionEvent);
</pre>
>Note: If the extension needs additional UI elements, first option we suggest is use the viewer UI [Autodesk.Viewing.UI.DockingPanel](https://forge.autodesk.com/en/docs/viewer/v2/reference/javascript/dockingpanel)

## Packages used

The [Autodesk Forge](https://www.npmjs.com/package/forge-apis) packages are included by default. Some other non-Autodesk packages are used, including [express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express) and [multer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer) for upload.

# Tips & tricks

For local development/ testing, consider using the [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) package, which auto-restarts your node application after any modification to your code. To install it, use:

    sudo npm install -g nodemon

Then, instead of **npm run dev**, use the following:

    npm run nodemon

Which executes **nodemon server.js --ignore www/**, where the **--ignore** parameter indicates that the app should not restart if files under the **www** folder are modified.

## Troubleshooting

After installing GitHub Desktop for Windows, on the Git Shell, if you see the ***error setting certificate verify locations*** error, then use the following command:

    git config --global http.sslverify "false"
